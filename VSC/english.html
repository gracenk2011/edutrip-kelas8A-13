    <h2>My First Night Market Experience</h2>
    <p>As soon as I walked into a bustling night market, the air filled with the smell of grilled squid, sweet bubble tea, and tasty braised pork rice. Bright lights flashed everywhere, making the place feel exciting and alive. People crowded around food stalls, eager to try something new. It wasn’t just a market—it was a festival of flavors, sounds, and colors.</p>

    <h2>Tasty Seafood Everywhere</h2>
    <p>Since Taiwan is surrounded by the sea, it’s famous for its fresh seafood. I tried crispy tempura, light and crunchy, bursting with flavor. The grilled scallops, covered in garlic butter, melted in my mouth. Every bite tasted like the ocean, reminding me of how important fishing is in Taiwan. Many seafood stalls even display tanks of live fish and shellfish, ensuring customers get the freshest ingredients possible. Some vendors grill fish right in front of you, brushing it with savory sauces that fill the air with an irresistible aroma. The variety of seafood, from giant prawns to tender squid, makes every visit to the market a new experience.</p>

    <h2>Yummy Snacks I Tried</h2>
    <p>One of the highlights of my trip was visiting Fengchia Night Market, a famous spot for street food. One of the strangest but tastiest snacks I tried was the Nutritious Sandwich—a deep-fried bun stuffed with cucumber, tomato, and a creamy egg filling. It was crispy on the outside and fresh on the inside. Another favorite was braised pork rice, warm and comforting, like a hug in a bowl.</p>

    <h2>Sweet Treats to Enjoy</h2>
    <p>For dessert, I had a bowl of taro ball soup. The chewy taro balls were fun to eat, and the light sweetness made it the perfect way to finish my meal. Of course, I couldn’t leave without trying brown sugar bubble tea. The sweet, caramel-like flavor mixed with creamy milk made every sip amazing. Another delightful treat was tanghulu, it was fruit coated in a crunchy sugar shell that cracked with every bite. The mix of sour and sweet was amazing. I also tried chocolate-covered strawberries, a simple yet delicious snack that felt like a perfect blend of fresh fruit and rich chocolate. Not only that, the prices there were all so cheap.</p>

    <h2>A Trip Full of Flavor</h2>
    <p>Taiwan’s street food is more than just tasty—it’s a fun way to learn about its culture. Every snack has a special story, and every bite is an adventure. If you ever visit Taiwan, make sure to explore the night markets. You’ll find amazing food and unforgettable memories!</p>
